	<summary>Simulate a simplistic forest fire on an iGPU</summary>
	<description>
		<p>You give an NxN (N = tree grid dimension) square matrix of trees initially, which contains live trees and some burning trees (ratio being controlled by the starting factor).

Starting factor (SF) is an 8 bit unsigned integer. A value of 255 means all trees are alive initially and 0 means all trees start off burning. Mathematically:

SF = 255 - ((# burning trees)/(N ^ 2) * 255)

A tree catches fire in the next iteration with a probability of 0.25 if at least one of its neighbouring trees is on fire.
Burning trees become dead in the next iteration.

The simulation ends when there are no burning trees left.

Epoch count is the number of iterations until the simulation ends.

This program simulates a forest fire on an iGPU (Integrated GPU).

Sample execution command: "./Simulator-x86_64.AppImage 15 220 true"
